QuickShift For Chrome
===================

The original Chrome extension for moving tabs around with your keyboard, brought back from the dead! 

Originally created during my BitterMinion Development days (www.bitterminion.com), I wrote the code for this extension in about one day and have barely touched it ever since. The truth is, I'm scared to look at it; I'm quite certain the code is abysmal. I lost all interest in maintaining it and eventually the code became so out of touch with the current Chrome API that I was forced to either update it or remove it from the Chrome store. I chose the latter. However, since removing it I have received no less than half a dozen requests to bring it back. But since I'm still completely disinterested in messing with it, I've decided to post the code online. If anyone wants to use it as the starting point for a new Chrome extension, go for it. All I ask for (pretty please, with salami on top) is a little credit for writing the original code. (Yeah, I like credit even for my shitty code. I'm kind of a whore like that.)
