QuickShiftForChrome
===================

The original Chrome extension for moving tabs around with your keyboard, brought back from the dead! 

Originally created during my BitterMinion Development days (www.bitterminion.com), I wrote the original code in about
one day and barely touched it since. The truth is, I'm scared to look at it. I'm quite certain the code is abysmal. I 
completely lost interest in maintaining it and eventually the code became so out of touch with the current Chrome API 
that I was forced to either update it or remove it from the Chrome store or update it. I chose the former. However, since removing it I have received no less than half a dozen requests to bring it back. As a compromise, I've decided to post the code online. If anyone wants to use it as the starting point for a new Chrome extension, go for it. All I ask for (pretty please, with salami on top) is a little credit for writing the original code. (Yeah, I like credit even for my shitty code. I'm kind of a whore like that.)
